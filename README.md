# top-library
## Introduction
A small library app to practice objects and other related concepts in JavaScript. Allows users to add book data through a menu, which, once confirmed, populates a grid in real time on the screen with the provided information.


## After-thoughts
While, there was very minimal practice with object usage, I used this as an opportunity to apply a different approach to CSS - based off of some exposure to Tailwind - in which I defined more general classes, instead of giving every element its own class and styling them individually. This was more interesting as it also changed th way I approached my HTML.
